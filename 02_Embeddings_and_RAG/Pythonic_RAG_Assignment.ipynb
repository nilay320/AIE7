Hence, when you're dealing with multiple documents, it allows for more efficient resource usage. In this case, we're making API calls and we don't need to block on an individual call as a result of using async! The allows for greater concurrency and faster run times."

      "The best way to write a loop in Python often depends on the context of what you're trying to accomplish. However, here are a few tips to write effective loops:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Use the Right Type of Loop**:\n",
      "   - For iterating over a sequence (like a list, tuple, or string), consider using a `for` loop. This is usually cleaner and more Pythonic than a `while` loop.\n",
      "   - Use a `while` loop when you need to repeat an action until a certain condition is met.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Keep It Readable**:\n",
      "   - Use meaningful variable names and maintain a clear structure. This improves code readability.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Avoid Modifying the List While Iterating**:\n",
      "   - If you need to remove elements from a list within a loop, consider creating a copy of the list or using list comprehensions.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Use `enumerate()`**:\n",
      "   - When you need both the index and the value from a list, use `enumerate()` to avoid manual indexing.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Consider List Comprehensions**:\n",
      "   - For simple cases, you can often achieve the same result more concisely with a list comprehension.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's an example of a `for` loop that iterates through a list:\n",
      "\n",
      "```python\n",
      "fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']\n",
      "\n",
      "for fruit in fruits:\n",
      "    print(fruit)\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "And here's an example of a loop using `enumerate()`:\n",
      "\n",
      "```python\n",
      "for index, fruit in enumerate(fruits):\n",
      "    print(f\"{index}: {fruit}\")\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "If you're doing something with a condition, here's a `while` loop example:\n",
      "\n",
      "```python\n",
      "count = 0\n",
      "while count < 5:\n",
      "    print(count)\n",
      "    count += 1\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",

This often occurs because the CEO finds it difficult to let go of the function that contributed to their success and thus chooses a less competent individual for the role to maintain their own prominence in that area. The example provided in the context describes Michael Eisner, who was previously a successful TV network executive but, after acquiring ABC for Disney, failed to improve its performance and expressed a belief that he could turn it around if he had more time. This illustrates the issue of hiring a weak executive to allow the CEO to continue feeling like a key player in that domain (Source 1).\n",

    "The primary strategy is called \"Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Prompting,\" where you add phrases like \"Let's think step by step\" to encourage the model to break down problems into intermediate reasoning steps. \"Few-Shot Prompting\" is another effective technique where you provide 2-5 examples of detailed responses, and the model learns to match that pattern and depth. For the most thoughtful responses, you can combine both methods by showing examples that include step-by-step reasoning.\n",

      "When considering startup funding, it's important to distinguish between two critical phases: Before Product/Market Fit and After Product/Market Fit.\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Before Product/Market Fit**: You should aim to raise enough money to achieve Product/Market Fit. It's essential to consider not only the minimum amount needed but also to secure a substantial buffer (or \"insurance\") to absorb unexpected challenges since the length of time to reach Product/Market Fit can be uncertain.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **After Product/Market Fit**: The goal should shift to raising enough capital to fully exploit the current opportunities and to achieve profitability while doing so.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, the context suggests that raising as much money as possible is generally advisable, as long as it doesn't lead to losing control of your company or result in irrational funding decisions. The entrepreneurs who thrived in previous eras often did so by raising considerable funds when the opportunity presented itself, which contributed significantly to their longevity and success.\n",
      "\n",
      "For exploring funding options, you might start with engaging potential venture capitalists (VCs) through effective pitches over time, as well as utilizing alternatives such as angel funding, bootstrapping, or maintaining a day job to support your startup financially until you're ready for growth.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, aim to secure ample funding, be strategic about when and how much you raise, and consider various funding sources to support your startup's growth effectively.\n",
